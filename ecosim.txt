can you make an mmo with a mob ecosystem?
- animals can be hunted to extinction
- there is a balance between predators and prey, and a food chain
- noobs are a part of the food chain... (lvl 1 spawning in an area with lvl 100 mobs = rip)
- naturalism/conservation/biology
- there is ecosystem balance, and then there is speciation/evolution: two separate problems
- mobs must differentiate in complex enough ways
- variables:
	- behavior (aggressive, neutral, passive)
	- speed
	- attack dmg
	- diet
- must simulate reproduction somehow...
	- animals must survive to a certain age, find a mate, protect their young
- build up from very simple stimulus-response model to complex policies:
	- child-care
	- mating patterns
	- reaction to enemies
	- feeding habits
- number of innate variables such as:
	- age
	- sexual maturity
	- size
	- speed
	- hunger
	- health
	- diet
- unique abilities (burrow, special attacks, etc)
- types of foliage (trees, bushes)
- types of terrain
	- water, etc

what effect does this have on gameplay?
- interesting dynamic effects on where mobs may be found
- emergent 'jobs' incl. science, conservation, breeding, etc


stimulus:
- long term context
	- age: 20
	- children: 3
- medium term context
	- 3:00PM
	- hungry
	- not sleepy
	- healthy
- short term context
	- child nearby
	- enemy nearby
	- food nearby

some genetic mapping from stimulus -> response
- in theory, over time, better mappings become more common
 as they are passed on
- (over a looooong loooooooong time e.g. thousands of generations...)
- "genes" are those mappings

possible responses:
- attack enemy
- flee
- stand ground
- attack child
- eat food
- walk randomly
- sleep

the harder part: conjunctive stimuli, like:
- <child nearby> AND <child unhealthy> AND <enemy nearby>
vs
  <child nearby> AND <child healthy> AND <enemy health>
OR
  <child nearby> AND <food nearby> AND <child hungry>

herbivore which eats plants
plants regenerate leaves over time
animals have dynamic stats: hunger, health
animals have static stats: healing rate, health rate, max health, move speed
animal behaviors: (eventually become evolving genetic rules)
- enemy in sight? run from enemy
- food in sight? move towards food
- mate in sight? move towards mate
- no food or enemy? "search for food"
	- how is the direction selected?
		- selected randomly once, and then follow until something changes (or for a certain duration)

MVP:
- perception (loop over nearby objects)
- eat (move towards perceived food, then eat)
- fuck (move towards perceived mate, then fuck)
- die (health bar reaches zero)
- hunger bar which depletes at a rate (according to activity, or constant rate)
	- affects health regen and eventually DOT
- search (random walk w/ memory)
- age
	- dying of age
	- sexual maturity

rabbit = {
	game: ->game;

	age: x,
	sex: male,
	health: 300,

	eat(x)
}

behavior genes:
[stimulus] => [response], WEIGHT
stimulus = {
	object_perceived
}

response = {
	MOVE_TOWARD_OBJECT
	EAT_OBJECT
	FIGHT_OBJECT
	FUCK_OBJECT
}

{
	stimulus: [
		"hungry",
		"see food"
	],
	response: "eat food"
}

stimuli
- hungry
- low health
- full health
- not hungry
- enemy nearby
- opposite sex nearby
- same sex nearby
- is male/is female
- food nearby

score = [how current stimulus fits gene stimulus description] * [weight of gene]
pick highest score (or make it probabalistic, score ~ likelihood of choice)

complex perception:
opposite sex nearby WHO 'just' killed an enemy
same sex nearby WHO 'was just' attacked

complex stimuli
-memory
	- there was food at (x, y)
	- that animal just killed someone
-empathy (understanding state of fellow entities)
	- that dude looks hungry
	- that dude is headed for the food
- should each individual stimulus component have a weight (or is 0/1 good enough?)

possible emergent behaviors:
- sexual selection
- child care
- society/group relations (?) (herd vs solitary)
	- tribe vs tribe more complex (long-term memory)
- nocturnality/diurnality
